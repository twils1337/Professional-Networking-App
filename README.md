# Professional Networking App
This is a professional networking application developed by my partner, Billy Xiao and myself during the Spring 2015
CS166: Database Management Systems class. It emulates LinkedIn's core functionality in that you 
can send requests to other professionals for networking purposes, send message other users, and create/develop 
their profiles to reflect their professional work experience and educational details.
